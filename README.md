# WEAR Clothes Recommender

## Introduction

The "WEAR Clothes Recommender" is an innovative solution designed to help you make clothing choices that match the weather and your personal preferences. It's the answer to the age-old question, "What should I wear today?"

## Motivation

We've all been thereâ€”staring out the window, uncertain about what to wear for the day or whether to bring that jacket for a night out. These everyday fashion dilemmas inspired the creation of WEAR, the Weather Engineered Apparel Recommender.

## Features

- **Weather-Based Recommendations:** WEAR analyzes current weather conditions to provide you with outfit suggestions suitable for the temperature, precipitation, and time of day.

- **Personalized User Experience:** Tailor your clothing recommendations to your unique style and comfort.

## Code Style

This project utilizes the following technologies and tools:

- **Python:** The core programming language used for development.
- **APIs:** Integration with Breezometer's Weather API to fetch real-time weather information.
- **Streamlit:** The user interface is built with Streamlit, providing a user-friendly experience.

## Testing and Validation

The notebooks included in this repository cover various phases of data testing. To ensure the accuracy of our recommendations, we simulated data and tested it against a linear regression model, achieving a high correlation coefficient of 0.99.

## How To Use

1. **API Setup:** Obtain an API key from Breezometer for their Weather API v1.
2. **Configuration:** Insert your API key into the file `Part_2-User_Creation_and_Weather_Prediction.ipynb` in two specific locations as mentioned in the notebook.
